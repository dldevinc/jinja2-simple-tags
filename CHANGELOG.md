# Change Log

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/dldevinc/jinja2-simple-tags/tree/v0.5.0) - 2023-04-27

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

-   The output of `StandaloneTag` is now escaped by default when the `autoescape` 
    environment option is set to `True`. This behavior can be changed using the new 
    `safe_output` [property](README.md#Escaping). When `safe_output` is set to `True`, 
    the output will not be escaped.
-   The `BaseTemplateTag.output()` method has been deprecated and is no longer available.
    Use the `BaseTemplateTag.create_node()` method instead.
